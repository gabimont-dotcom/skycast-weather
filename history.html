    <h2>History of Weather Forecasting</h2>
    <p>1. When and why weather forecasting was created

Weather forecasting began in the early 1800s when scientists wanted a way to predict storms, protect ships, and reduce deaths from severe weather. The earliest forecasts were based on simple observations of wind, clouds, and air pressure.

2. How it has grown over the years

Telegraph technology in the 1840s allowed weather data to be shared quickly for the first time.

In 1870, the U.S. Weather Bureau was created.

Radar was introduced in the 1940s to track storms.

Satellites in the 1960s allowed forecasts to become global.

Computer models in the 1970s–2000s improved accuracy dramatically.

Modern APIs now deliver real-time, location-based data instantly.

3. Where weather forecasting stands today

Today, weather forecasting uses satellites, radar, ocean buoys, and advanced computer models. Real-time data is available through APIs like OpenWeather, allowing apps (like your SkyCast project) to show instant forecasts anywhere in the world.
