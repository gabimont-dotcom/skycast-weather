    <h2>History of Weather Forecasting</h2>

    <h3>1. When and Why Weather Forecasting Was Created</h3>
    <p>
      Weather forecasting began in the early 1800s when scientists needed a way to predict storms,
      protect ships, and reduce deaths from severe weather. Early forecasts were based on basic
      observations of wind direction, clouds, and air pressure.
    </p>

    <h3>2. How Weather Forecasting Has Grown Over the Years</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Telegraph technology in the 1840s allowed weather data to be shared quickly for the first time.</li>
      <li>In 1870, the U.S. Weather Bureau was created.</li>
      <li>Radar was introduced in the 1940s to track storms.</li>
      <li>Satellites in the 1960s made global forecasting possible.</li>
      <li>Computer models from the 1970s–2000s greatly increased prediction accuracy.</li>
      <li>Modern APIs now deliver real-time, location-based weather data instantly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Where Weather Forecasting Stands Today</h3>
    <p>
      Today, weather forecasting relies on satellites, radar, ocean buoys, and advanced computer models.
      Real-time data is available through APIs like OpenWeather, allowing websites and apps (like SkyCast)
      to provide instant forecasts anywhere in the world.
